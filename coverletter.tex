    \begin{cvletter}

        \lettersection{About Me}
        Prior to my taking my first programming class in college, I was unaware careers in computer science, or any type of engineering for that matter.
        I didn't grow up with many engineering influences around me, but after I finished my programming course at UC Davis, I decided to turn computer science into my passion. \\ \\
        After quickly realizing that many of my peers were years ahead of me in terms of programming skills, I made it a clear goal of mine to surround myself in the computer science culture / community in order to catch up.
        I listen to podcasts (CodingBlocks is one my favorites), picked up positions of leadership relating to computer science (as seen on my resume), and worked on side projects (the MEAN stack is my current interest).
        Aside from programming, I also have interests in photography and snowboarding!

        \lettersection{Why Reddit?}
        The idea of becoming one of Reddit's very first software engineer interns would be an amazing experience.
        Although there are social media platforms out there that enable users to write about their thoughts and ideas, none of them accomplish such tasks like Reddit, and with that, I strongly believe that Reddit's mission to serve as the voice of the internet is unique in itself. \\ \\
        One of the goals of the internet is to serve as a playing field where everyone has equal power, and Reddit has truly taken advantage of that.
        When a team of SpaceX software engineers or the CEO of a company like Reddit or Tesla wants to gather feedback on their product or just open the floor up to questions to the general public, they turn to Reddit as a platform for doing so.
        I want to bring my passion to the workplace and work on a product that many people love, myself included.

        \lettersection{Why Me?}
        Normally, I wouldn't bring this skill up because I assume it's implied, but I have good communication skills that come from regularly working with teams (the clubs previously mentioned).
        Reducing ambiguity / mis-communication takes practice to some extent, and through my experiences with working in teams, I believe I am well versed in this skill. \\ \\
        Additionally, I would be an investment that would reach much further than Reddit.
        I consider myself an influencer to some extent because of the positions of leadership I hold in my computer science community at UC Davis.
        One of the things I love to do is mentoring other individuals and seeing them succeed.
        If chosen for this internship, my contributions to Reddit wouldn't end by the end of the summer.
        I would share my experiences with other passionate individuals and encourage them to apply.
        Given all that I've said, I look forward to a potential opportunity to work in an amazing company!
