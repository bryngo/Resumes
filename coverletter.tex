\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
Aside from programming, I'm in to photography, snowboarding, and, of course, gaming (Summoner Name: BubblyBryan)! I also tend to gravitate towards holding and finding positions of leadership wherever I go. I became one UC Davis's computer science club officers because I completely believe in the club mission of cultivating a welcoming and valuable computer science community on campus. The point here being when I do join an organization, I become passionate about the mission statement and will do everything in my power to meet it. Given the opportunity, I would love to align myself with Riot's mission.

\lettersection{Why Riot?}
I'm choosing Riot because eSports is huge, and there's evidence of it everywhere. NBA teams such as the Warriors and the Cavs are even securing spots in the NA LCS! In short, Riot in particular owns one of the biggest, if not the biggest, eSport to date - League of Legends. I want to be at the forefront of engineering this exploding field, and I could think of no better way than helping make the game a more enjoyable experience for the millions of daily active users who play it at Riot.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I love the product. I love it so much that I made all my friends, who are also programmers, come to weekly meetings to work on Discord Bots using the Riot API. It was the perfect combination programming and gaming. \\ \\
It's a bit clique to say, but League of Legends is much more than just a pass time to me. It has provided with a way to keep in touch with all my friends, who I don't see very often. With that being said, I know for a fact that I'm not the only one who shares this feeling. If I were to become a software engineer intern for Riot, I would keep all of those individuals who play the game like me in mind. I'm grateful for what Riot has provided to myself and many others, and I have the urge to share my passion and give back by writing meaningful lines of code.
