%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I was introduced to computer science during my senior year of high school, but didn't fully devote myself to it until my first year of college. Since then, I've been actively participating in ways to immerse myself in the computer science culture by joining clubs, attending tech events, and programming! I also love photography and snowboarding!

\lettersection{Why Slack?}
Ever since I joined my first club as an officer in college, Slack has been my first choice when deciding a primary means of communication with groups. This platform for messaging has put other platforms such as Facebook Messenger or Discord out of the question. With the large variety of plugins to use, such as continuous integration or event scheduling, Slack is an extremely versatile platform. I want to help engineer the next big thing the company decides to take on.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I'm passionate about programming, and I want to bring my passion to the workplace. The energy and curiosity I can offer to a team will present new perspectives and new ideas to improve Slack. Additionally, I can contribute to the company culture. My investment in photography has taught me how to make meaningful relationships with strangers. These soft skills, that I believe are not found in most candidates, is such an invaluable skill that I can contribute to a team.
